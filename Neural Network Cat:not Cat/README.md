# Project Description

Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
 In this project,I build an image recognition algorithm. I built a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!


I aim to increase the accuracy to 80+ %  on cat vs. non-cat datasets on future projects.

I learnt:

- Working with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learnt how to minimize the cost function.

- Understood how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
